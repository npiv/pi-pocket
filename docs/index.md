# Pi Pocket's documentation

For agents (and people) who change how Pi works in Pi Pocket, extend Pi Pocket, or change its code. Pi's system prompt gives the absolute paths; links here are relative to this folder.

## Where things are

- **The code:** the folder above this one (`web/`, `src/`, `docs/`, `test/`). It runs straight from these files: there is no build.
- **The data:** `~/.pi-pocket/`, or `PI_POCKET_DIR` (the launcher shows it as **Data**). `config.json` holds people, roles, tokens, invites, and settings; `pocket.sqlite` holds every session; `extensions/` holds the owner's drop-in extensions. Change data through the app, never by editing these files: the server keeps them in memory and writes over them. The one exception is `extensions/`, where drop-ins go ([extensions.md](extensions.md)).
- **Shared user files:** `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` for instructions and `~/.agents/skills/` for skills. Pi Pocket also reads `~/.pi/agent/` for sign-ins, models, configuration, `AGENTS.md`, and prompt templates.

## Pick the lightest change

Each step reaches further than the one before it, and asks more care. Use the first that does the job.

| To change                                                          | Use                                                                         | Read                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| How Pi works in one session                                        | The session's instructions (Menu → Instructions for Pi)                     | [customizing.md](customizing.md)   |
| How Pi works in a project, or everywhere                           | An `AGENTS.md` in the project, or `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`                     | [customizing.md](customizing.md)   |
| A procedure Pi should follow on request                            | A skill, or a prompt template: both become slash commands                   | [customizing.md](customizing.md)   |
| What Pi can do: a new tool, a rule in its prompt, a check on calls | A drop-in extension in `~/.pi-pocket/extensions/`, which the owner turns on | [extensions.md](extensions.md)     |
| Pi Pocket itself: its screens, its server, a built-in extension    | Its code, while it runs                                                     | [self-editing.md](self-editing.md) |

A drop-in extension survives updates to Pi Pocket and can be turned off from the app; a change to Pi Pocket's code is shared by everyone who uses this copy and can break it for all of them.

## The documents

- [customizing.md](customizing.md): changing how Pi works without code.
- [extensions.md](extensions.md): writing extensions (tools, prompt sections, hooks), with working examples in [examples/](examples/).
- [self-editing.md](self-editing.md): changing Pi Pocket's code while it runs, checking the change, and getting a broken one back.
- [map.md](map.md): where each part of the code is, and how to add the common things.
- [architecture.md](architecture.md): how the parts depend on each other, and the orderings they rely on.
- [features.md](features.md): what each feature does, as people use it.
- [../SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md): what Pi Pocket protects, and what it does not.

## Before you change anything

- **Ask first.** A change to Pi Pocket reaches everyone who uses it, at once. Say what you will change and why, and wait for a yes, unless you were asked for exactly that.
- **Do not test on the live data.** Check a change on a copy of Pi Pocket with its own data folder ([self-editing.md](self-editing.md#check-it-on-a-copy)), not with the server people are using.
- **Do not restart while your own tool call runs**, and do not restart without asking. Tell the person to use Menu → Restart server.
- **Do not commit, push, or publish** unless asked.
